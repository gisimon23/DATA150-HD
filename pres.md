## Natural Disasters; Improvement Through Data Science
# Abstract
This presentation is based off months of work compiling literature, analysing methods, identifying gaps, and proposing solutions. The research focuses on bettering disaster management and response specifically in China. China has a large population and growing rate of natural disasters. With disaster management there is prevention, forecasting, response, and recovery. Each parts are crucial in minimizing lives endangered and damage created. The dimensions of humans touched upon in this research include a long and healthy life as well as a decent standard of living. Having systems that can monitor and predict natural disasters gives humans a higher chance of survival. Being able to reach those seeking medical assistance more quickly increases survival. The recognition of natural disasters and timely response ultimately allow for individuals to have a longer and healthier life. By using systems to analyze the damage and give aid after disaster gives individuals a decent standard of living. Methods used in this research process include Earth observation, UAVs, and an integrated disaster information service. Gaps in the literature is addressed and a new research plan is proposed in order to create the most efficient ways to combat natural disasters.
