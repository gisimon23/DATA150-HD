The article “Hidden Dept Plagues China’s Belt and Road Infrastructure Plan, Studies Find” by James T. Areddy was short in length but had a lot to take in. The focus of the article is China’s management of funds particularly to needy countries for infrastructure projects. The mere numbers being discussed is hard for me to comprehend. The fact that there is “$843 billion in Chinese loans between 2000 and 2017” is unfathomable. I question the point at which countries decide they have loaned out too much or have acquired too much debt. I have always thought money transfer among different countries to be tricky because at the end of the day, who monitors it or makes sure it is fair. On one hand it should be up to the two countries to decide their terms but I also think the International Committee should monitor transactions so big countries like China do not take advantage of smaller countries like the Balkaans with interest rates four times higher than other lenders.
