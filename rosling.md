1. When Hans Rosling surveyed his students in choosing which countries had higher child mortality rates his students performed poorly, averaging 1.8 out of 5 responses correct. When comparing these results with chimpanzees, the chimps actually scored higher. This showed Rosling that humans have preconcieved notions.
2. Before Asia grew economically, they rose in health. Once child mortality rates lowered and health became better, the economy followed. Rosling noted you must become healthy first instead of wealthy first. 
3. In accordance with Hans Rosling's TED talk there is a relation between child mortality and GDP. There is a strong link that suggest that as child's survival rate goes up, as does the GDP per capita. 
4. From 1962 to 2003 the world has changed drastically especially in regards to income distribution. Overall GDP per capita have grown around the world. However the improvement cannot be averaged for each country but more specifi. Some countries have risen in income more quickly than others. People tend to use money better now.
5. Rosling has a very intellectual perspective and reasoning in rgards to how he uses data to describe global human development. He acknowledges how much we need data and that the information recieved from data is much more meaningful than the possible weakness data has. He harks on spatial solutions because when it comes to averaging a countries wealth. He gave an example how Africa has everything you could imagine as well as super poor. This means more detailed solutions in response to health and aid. 
6. Rosling shows deep passion when giving his TED talk. He has done intense research and is confident and proud of his findings. His work is so signifgant because he shows people the data is there for us to use. He demonstrates what to look at and what certain things mean. Him worker with Gapminder gives people the stating points for what they need so they can branch off as "flowers." People will be able to look at and see income distribution etc. to understand trends and human development. He wants people beyond statisticians and anaylsts to be able to looks at this data freely.
